# Description
This is GifTastic, a page that was styled with bootstrap and jquery to be mobile responsive. It dynamically creates buttons from an array of topics. Those buttons make an ajax call to giphy.com, with a limit of 15 gifs at a time, and then appends those to the dom where the user can click the image tile to make the gif play and pause. The user has the ability to add new topics to the array, this will automatically create a button and launch the ajax call for them upon submitting the form.
